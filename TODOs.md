- [ ] Refactor the UI. Models are no longer maintained in the "All models" section. Instead, you there is a a big card with a + Add Model button. Clicking it opens a modal with a list of all available models. Selecting one adds it in an empty state card to the results view on the right. This empty state card has a button to generate an image. The model card should also have a cog so you can edit the model parameters (temperature, max tokens, enable reasoning etc). This is now in the left side, but should move to the model card. After generation the card shows the image and below it a button to change the settings (which opens the same modal as before) and a button to regenerate the image. Also remove the "Save all" button. Build the UI from scratch, but use the existing UI as inspiration for the look & feel.
- [ ] Refactor the database modelling. We should move to two tables: one for the artwork group. This contains the description (prompt), the title, the category. The other for the individual artworks. This contains a foreign key to the artwork group, the model used, the parameters (temperature, max tokens etc) and the resulting image (svg). This way we can have multiple images for the same prompt, but different models/parameters. All models should also include common metadata like created_at, updated_at etc. Update the API endpoints accordingly.
- [ ] Add script to upload sqlite db to remote after adding models.
